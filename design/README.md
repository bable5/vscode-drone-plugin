Based on 'File Expleror' sidepanel.

## MVP:
Tree will be a list of pipelines.
Double click on any item in the tree and it will take you to the part of the drone file.

## Next:
Search feature?
Dependency graph? Flows to/Flows from info
View to 'draw' the pipeline.

## Questions:
How do we parse a yaml file?
Something out of the box? Or hand-role one.
  - Interface -> FilePath -> List<DronePipeline> then can adapt whatever.
